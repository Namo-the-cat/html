  <h1>HTML README</h1>
    <p>The repositary "HTML" is a line of HTML code, the code that is behind every site. The code I am typing here is even HTML.</p>
   <h2>Why, Namo?</h2>
    <p>Because that's the only coding language I know about.</p>
     <h2>How did you?</h2>
      <p>I put the html part first, and then I did all that text in there. Below this is the end of the body part. It look likes /body and /html.</p>
